## Add your event to this calendar
Please send a meeting invitation to [rc2communitycalendar@gmail.com](mailto:rc2communitycalendar@gmail.com) and it will be automatically added. Be sure to include date, time, location, and description. All will be displayed within the calendar. Please include a link to your event if there's an official event page so we can direct people there for any updates.

!!! Note

    If this is the first time you have sent a meeting invite, it will need to be manually accepted by site administrators before it will show up on the calendar. Once accepted, all future invites will be automatically accepted.
