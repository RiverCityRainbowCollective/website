<h1>Welcome to the Wiki!</h1>
<p>Here is where we'll put all our important instructions on how to contribute to the RC2 Resource Website</p>
<h2>Contributing to the Website</h2>
<p>If you look at the sidebar on the left, you'll see a <code>website</code> folder. This folder contains all the markdown (.md) files that will end up on the website. Everything outside of that folder will not be included.</p>
<h3>Website File Structure</h3>
<p>The structure of the files inside the <code>website</code> folder are hierarchical by category. This hierarchy will end up as the base navigation inside the website. You can create the structure as needed to add additional categories of resources. You accomplish this by editing the file path when you create a new page.</p>
<h3>Only Markdown files are supported on the website!</h3>
<p>All files inside the website folder should be created via the <code>Markdown</code> text editor. The website software we use accepts markdown files and renders them into HTML files before the website is fully deployed.</p>
<p>If you create a file with a different editor (not markdown) inside the website folder, it won't break anything but that page will not show up in the website. There is an option to “convert” the page to another format, you can try that to convert it to markdown, but there's a risk of loss of formatting, so you may need to revisit the format of the page after conversion.&nbsp;</p>
