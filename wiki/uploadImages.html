<h1>How to Upload Images</h1>

</ol>

<p>2. Select the <code>wiki-assets</code> folder to ensure we upload our assets there. We want to keep our asset files organized so they don't clutter up the wiki. If you've already uploaded assets in this session, you may be already in the <code>wiki-assets</code> folder.</p>

<p>3. Browse for files on your local system or Drag and Drop them into the box. This would also be a good place to create a new folder for your page to store the assets just for your page, to keep things even more organized. This is optional but recommended.&nbsp;</p>
