<h1>Wiki Structure</h1>
<p>The Wiki is split into 2 sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Website<ol>
      <li>Contains all files related to the River City Rainbow Collective website.</li>
      <li>This is where our resource directory and blog resides.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Access to the website files is restricted to the Website Editor role.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Files created in here must be made using the Markdown editor.</li>
      <li>No delete access</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Wiki<ol>
      <li>General use wiki</li>
      <li>Everyone with Discord access can create and edit anything in the /wiki directory</li>
      <li>No delete access</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the wiki overall is to consolidate information that we want to store and organize for later use. The wiki directory can become a central pool of information that can be copied into the website directory to be included on our website.</p>
<p>Feel free to mess around (on your own file) and contribute any information you feel is important to document.</p>
