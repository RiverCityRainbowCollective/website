<h3 >Driver's License / State ID</h3>
<p >Correcting the gender marker on your State ID or driver's license is quick and easy! It's the same process for both.</p>
<p >If you have your gender marker corrected at the same time as your renew your License or State ID, you will be able to do it free of charge. If not, then a fee will apply.</p>

<p >Fill out this form completely, by hand, in pen, and bring it with you to your local secretary of state facility or DMV. You will have a choice between M, F, or X for your corrected marker. </p>
<p >You will receive a temporary paper copy of your license or ID. Your corrected license or ID will arrive in the mail within 15 days.</p>
<p class="callout info" >Some activists suggest that given current circumstances, having an X on your identifications may cause you more trouble or harm than having an M or F. Your gender is valid regardless of what shows on your legal identification. We know individual action cannot change systemic issues, therefore it begs the question if individual interactions with law enforcement is the right place to "protest" by having an X marker. At the end of the day it's your journey, identity, and choice. </p>
<p class="callout warning" >Changing the gender marker on your license or ID will result in a change to your license or ID number. If your license or ID number are on file anywhere, i.e. work, bank, car insurance, make sure you update those with the new number ASAP!</p>
<h3 >Birth Certificate</h3>

<p >Birth certificate corrections for any individual born in Illinois with an existing Illinois birth certificate are handled by the vital records division of the Department of Public Health. To request this correction, you will need an affidavit and certificate of correction request form. </p>
