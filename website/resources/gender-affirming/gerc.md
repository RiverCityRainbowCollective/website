# Gender Expansive Resource Center
Gender Expansive Resource Center is a partnership between Prairie Pride Coalition, Unitarian Universalist Church of Bloomington-Normal, and Universalist-Unitarian Church of Peoria.

The center provides low to no cost gender-affirming resources for the trans, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming community of Central Illinois

Resources include binders, gaffs, shapers, packers, and referrals and vouchers for community services and organizations.

We offer fitting appointments and pick up for some items and postal delivery for others.
