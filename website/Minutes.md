# Meeting Minutes
We meet monthly to organize our collective efforts.

We call this meeting `Collective Congress` to set the tone that this time is for coming together as a collective and discussing how we can support ourselves and our community.

We usually have time set aside after official business to socialize and hang out.

If you would like to view our meeting minutes, they are available at the link below
