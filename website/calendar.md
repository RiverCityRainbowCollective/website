## How to Submit Your Event to Our Community Calendar

To ensure your event is accurately listed on our community calendar, please follow the process below for submitting a calendar invite. This method helps us streamline event postings and maintain the integrity of our calendar, avoiding the need for manual entry that comes with regular email submissions.

#### **Step 1: Create Your Event in Your Calendar App**

1. Open your preferred calendar application (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).
2. Create a new event, filling in all relevant details such as the event title, date, time, and location. Include a detailed description to inform attendees about the event.

#### **Step 2: Invite Us to Your Event**

1. In the guest or invitee section of your event, enter our dedicated submission email address: `rc2communitycalendar@gmail.com`.
2. Before sending the invite, ensure that any attachments or additional information you wish attendees to know are included in the event details.

#### **Step 3: Send the Calendar Invite**

- After double-checking the event details for accuracy, send the calendar invite to our submission email address.

#### **Important Notes:**

- **Do Not Send Regular Emails:** Please refrain from sending event details through regular email. Events must be submitted as calendar invites to be considered for inclusion in our community calendar.
- **Updating Event Details:** If any event details change after you've submitted your calendar invite, please update the event in your calendar app and ensure the updated invite is sent to our submission email address.
- **First Time Calendar Invites:** If this is the first time you have sent a calendar invitation, it will need to be manually accepted by site administrators before it will show up on the calendar. Once accepted, all future invites will be automatically accepted. 

    

By following these steps, you can efficiently submit your event to be featured on our community calendar, ensuring it reaches our community accurately and effectively. Thank you for contributing to our vibrant community events calendar!
