## How to Add Your Event

Want to share your event with the community? Here's how:

### 1. Make Your Event
- Open your calendar app (like Google Calendar)
- Create a new event
- Add all the important details (time, place, what it's about)

### 2. Send It to Us
- Add this email to your event: `rc2communitycalendar@gmail.com`
- Send the calendar invite

### Important Things to Know
- Only send calendar invites (not regular emails)
- If you need to change anything, just update the event and send it again
- First-time events need to be approved before they show up

That's it! Your event will appear on our community calendar once approved. ðŸŽ‰
